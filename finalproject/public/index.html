<h1>Are You Planning on Tranferring Credit?</h1>
<p>Broad College Transfer Guidelines (updated March 2015)
<br>
Guidelines for Pre-Approval and/or Re-Evaluation of Transfer Courses
at Domestic & International Institutions (Non-Study Abroad Programs)
</p>

<p>
<b>I.  INTRODUCTION</b><br>
<br>
Broad College Faculty review courses completed in transfer for 200 level
Accounting courses, and all 300 & 400 level business courses in Accounting,
Finance, General Business Law, Information Technology Management, Management,
Marketing and Supply Chain Management.<br>
<br>
Economics courses are reviewed by Faculty in the Department of Economics.
To have an Economics course evaluated, please take a current syllabus to
the Department of Economics in 110 Marshall-Adams Hall.
</P>

<p>
<b>II. BROAD TRANSFER COURSE POLICIES</b><br>
<br>
Broad College faculty evaluate transfer course credit in business fields based
on guidelines provided by its academic units for courses of similar content,
level, and academic quality, completed at accredited colleges and universities.<br>
<br>
A)  Business Courses at the 100-200 Level<br>
<br>
Courses similar in title to those offered by the Broad College at the 300–400
level are not authorized to receive specific course credit if taken at the
100–200 level at another institution.  However, general course credit may be awarded.<br>
<br>
B)  Business Courses at the 300-400 Level<br>
<br>
Students requesting to transfer a 300-400 level business course from a domestic
or international institution, must work with their academic adviser to obtain
faculty approval. A maximum of nine transfer credits at the 300-400 level may
be applied to a student’s undergraduate degree requirements.  Business courses
at the 300-400 level must be completed at an AACSB (The Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business) accredited institution.  You may check for AACSB
accreditation at:  http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp<br>
<br>
Students must be a junior or senior in order to transfer in courses evaluated as
the equivalent of 300 & 400 level Broad courses<br>
<br>
C)  Business Core and Major Field Courses<br>
<br>
Students must complete the Business Core course in their major at MSU.  This
ensures students are provided with the foundation material needed for the major
field courses.  The foundation business core courses by major are:<br>
<br>
  Finance – FI 311
  General Management – MGT 315
  Human Resource Management – MGT 315
  Marketing – MKT 300
  Supply Chain Management – SCM 303<br>
<br>
Students should also complete their Major Field courses at MSU. In some
circumstances, permission to transfer a Major Field course may be granted, but
it must be approved in writing by your Department Chairperson and by the
Director of Undergraduate Academic Services. A student should have a strong
academic record to make such a request.<br>
<br>
The Business Core Capstone course MGT 409 “Business Policy and Strategic
Management” AND Major Field Capstone courses designated with a “W” must
be completed at MSU.
</P>
<p>
<b>III. TRANSFER CREDIT PLANNING PROCEDURES</b><br>
<br>
Pre-Approval of Transfer Credits – Broad students planning to transfer courses
from a community college or a four-year institution must have the courses
approved in advance.  This also pertains to MSU Direct Enrollment Study Abroad
Programs.  Failure to obtain prior approval may result in the delay, failure,
or inadequate posting of credits from the transfer institution to their MSU
academic record. Advance approval may be obtained through:<br>
<br>
1)   TRANSFER MSU – MSU’s Searchable Transfer Credit Equivalency System
   http://transfer.msu.edu/
   Courses listed on Transfer MSU have been pre-approved by Faculty Reviewers.<br>
<br>
–OR–<br>
<br>
2)   Broad Faculty Reviewers – Students may take a current syllabus of the
course/s to be evaluated to Undergraduate Academic Services, 402A Eppley Center.
The syllabus must include a course description, name of the textbook/s, homework
assignments, quiz/exam information, and name and contact information of the
professor. The syllabus will be reviewed by a Broad Faculty Reviewer.
An e-mail notification of the Faculty Reviewer’s decision will be sent
to the student’s MSU e-mail address.<br>
<br>
Re-Evaluation of Transfer Credits – New transfer students to Broad may have a
business course from their transfer institution re-evaluated if they did not
receive credit after the initial evaluation or they feel the transfer course
was not evaluated appropriately. Please follow the procedure outlined in item 2.<br>
<br>
Guest Application Form – Students planning to attend accredited Michigan
institutions should use the Michigan Uniform Undergraduate Guest Application
form.  The Guest Application Form is online at:
  http://www.reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/EnrReg/GuestStatus.asp<br>
<br>
Students who wish to attend non-Michigan institutions should obtain application
forms from the host institution.<br>
<br>
Final Transcript of Transfer Course/s- In order to receive transfer credit,
official transcripts should be mailed to:<br>
<br>
  Office of Admissions<br>
  Michigan State University<br>
  Hannah Administration Bldg.<br>
  426 Auditorium Road, Room 250<br>
  East Lansing, MI 48824-2604<br>
  <br>
  Per University Policy, a minimum grade of a 2.0 must be earned in each course
  in order for the credit to be transferred to Michigan State University.
</p>

<p>

Students who have matriculated at Michigan State University and achieved junior
standing (56 semester credits) may not earn credits from two-year institutions.
Students who have matriculated at Michigan State University and not yet achieved
junior standing (56 semester credits) may earn credits from two-year institutions
up to the 56 semester credit limit.<br>
<br>
With prior approval, students may complete course/s at a two-year institution
after 56 credits in order to fulfill degree requirements or prerequisites.
